                D@B (Dorms at Brown) was developed as a final project for Introduction to Software
                Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                In previous years, there has been a lack of information regarding housing around campus, making it
                difficult to choose dorms and form groups during the housing process. Students
                in the past created
                <a href="https://brownbeardens.com/">Brown Bear Dens</a>
                in order to provide some information about the dorms including a list of rooms and floor
                plans for each dorm. While this site has been helpful, it lacks key information such as images,
                characteristics of dorms, opinions of students, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                To address this, my group and I created D@B. This site incorporates the previously mentioned
                information and more into the following features:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    User authentication/login in order to verify that users are Brown University students
                </li>
                <li>
                    A user profile that contains user information and reviews written
                </li>
                <li>
                    Filtering based on specific attributes of dorms
                </li>
                <li>
                    A dorm profile that contains information about each dorm and ability to view and write
                    reviews for each dorm
                </li>
                <li>
                    A survey that recommends dorms based on the user's preferences
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>
                IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
            </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                During the project, I focused on implementing the dorm filtering. This process required
                collecting filter information from users to send a post request to the backend, gather data
                from the database to filter, and update the page based on the filtered data.
            </p>

            <h3> Collecting User Input to Make POST Requests </h3>
            <p>
                The first step in the filtering process involved collecting user information, specifically,
                the filter categories and the filter types. On the right side of the dorms page, I created a
                sidebar for the users to select different filters based on the categories (room type, location,
                bathroom, kitchen, year, and other). Additionally, I designed the UI to allow users to select
                filters from multiple categories and filters from the same category. For example, if a housing group
                was looking for either 2 doubles or a suite on south campus, they would be able to filter by doubles
                and suites on south campus.

                    <p class="caption">Bathroom and Kitchen Filters</p>
                </div>
                <div class="single-figure">
                    <img src="../images/dab_page/filters3.png" alt="filters grid">
                    <p class="caption">Location and Year Filters</p>

                    <p class="caption">Other Filters</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                When a user clicks on one of the filters, a POST request is made using the filter route in
                the backend. This request is sent with a list of the filter categories and a list of the
                corresponding selected filters as the parameters.
            </p>

            <h3> Gathering Data and Filtering </h3>
            <p>
                Once the POST request is made, the backend handles filtering the dorms. Each dorm and its
                attributes (dorm name, room types, loaction, etc.) are stored in a Firebase Realtime Database.
                In the backend, I store all dorm data in a list of Dorm objects where I represent each
                attribute of the dorm as a field within the object. In addition, I store a list of current
                filtered dorms in order to apply multiple filters.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of actual filtering, I first iterate through each filter in the list sent through the
                POST request parameters. Each filter category has its own filter function. These functions then
                iterate through a list of current filtered dorms to determine whether the current dorm has
                the inputted attribute. Once all filters have been applied, a list of the
                filtered dorm names is sent back to the frontend.
            </p>

            <h3> Updating the Frontend </h3>
            <p>
                Once the frontend has a list of filtered dorm names, the page gets update with the corresponding
                dorm profiles. Each dorm profile has an ID that is the dorm's name. In turn, I only display the
                dorm profiles with IDs corresponding to the list of filtered dorm names by setting the display to
                'flex' or 'none'.

                Testing was split into two categories: frontend and backend. The frontend testing was
                comprised of user testing/feedback, and the backend testing was comprised of unit tests for
                each function used for filtering.
            </p>

            <h3> Frontend Testing </h3>
            <p>
                For frontend and user testing, my group and I asked our friends to explore our site and
                tell us any bugs they notice or any features they would like to see. Below are the notable
                changes made from user testing:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Multiple Filters From the Same Category
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Original Version: I originally designed the filter sidebar so that users could
                            only select one filter from each category at a time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Suggestion: It could be the case that users are looking for dorms that have multiple
                            filters attributes from the same categroy (eg. doubles and suites).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Category for Year
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Original Version: I did not have a category for year in the original design.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Suggestion: Freshman and upperclassmen housing are different. Additionally,
                            the housing lottery only applies to upperclassmen housing, so adding a filter
                            based on this will help students find available dorms during the housing process.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Deselecting All Filters
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Original Version: In the original version, after selecting some filters and then
                            deselecting them, none of the dorm profiles appear.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Suggestion: Rather than having a blank page show, the original page with all the
                            dorm profiles should appear when all filters are deselected.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3> Backend Testing </h3>
            <p>
                The backend testing involved unit tests to ensure that the filtering process worked as
                expected. In order to test the filter functions corresponding to each category, I created a
                list of 5 Dorm objects with particular attributes to checked whether the expected output of a
                certain filter matched the actual output. I also created unit tests to determine whether
                applying multiple filters functions as expected by matching the expected output to the actual
                output. I also tested edge cases, such as filtering a list with a single Dorm object and filtering
                an empty list which helped my find some bugs with the original code.
