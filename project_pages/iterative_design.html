            <p>
                Iterative Design is a project desinging an interactice interface for an emerging startup, and
                working through the process of mocking up a solution to the startup's concept and adjusting
                designs based on critiques. The first part of the project,
                <a href="#sketching">Sketching and Wireframes</a>,
                involved created different sketches and wireframes in order to visualize your ideas and
                weigh the benefits of alternative designs. The second part of the project,
                <a href="#mockups">Mockups</a>,
                involved creating high-fidelity prototypes that modeled user interaction with the interface and
                revising these mockups based on received critiques. The final part of the project,
                <a href="#user-testing">User Testing</a>,
                involved designing questions based on intented user interaction and analyzing the results of
                user testing.

            <h3>Pre-Design and Thinking</h3>
            <p>
                For this interface, we have decided to create a mobile app. Because of the
                on-demand nature of the app, we feel that a mobile app will provide the most
                flexibility and convenience to the users. The target audience for this app will
                be the adult population who have a mobile device; specifically targeting young adults.

            <p>
                My group and I started by creating sketches with ideas on how we would design the Food
                Court Application.

            <p>
                After sketching, we came together as a group to discuss which features and pages were most important to
                have in out final wireframe. Most of our sketches had similar ideas, all including some kind of search
                page, a home page and a restaurant page. Our final high fidelity wireframe had 5 total pages; a login
                page, a home page, a search page, a restaurant page and a checkout page. Below is an image of our final
                sketches.

            <p>
                In studio, we presented our design to a group of our classmates. After giving them time to use the
                interface, we were given 10 minutes of critiques about our design.
            </p>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>SEARCH BAR</span> on Search page: there was no easy way to navigate out of the search screen
                    without
                    clicking on a restaurant first. This caused some confusion and frustration for users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>HOURS</span> on Restaurant page: on the restaurant page, someone noted that the hours section
                    was not as
                    clear as they wanted it to be. They suggested to add an "open" & "closed" banner to more clearly
                    indicate to the user if the restaurant is open or closed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>HOURS</span> on Search page: Several users were confused by the "hours" placeholder on the
                    search page in
                    out design. They were expecting to see the actual store hours or be able to click on hours to have
                    them show up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>REVIEWS</span> on Restaurant page: we have review ratings for each restaurant in our designs,
                    but several
                    users mentioned that they would have liked to see the number of reviews for each restaurant to help
                    them determine the accuracy of the rating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>NOTES</span> section on Cart page: overall we got great reviews on the cart; one user
                    mentioned that the
                    contrast of the "notes" text could be improved to increase readability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>DELETE</span> on Cart page: there is a red delete button in the cart that allows users to take
                    an item out
                    of the cart. Some users felt that the red button with "delete" text wasn't clear and that a trash
                    can icon would be more clear to the user
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                In order to test the flow of the app, we decided to have each user order chicken tacos from Deddeh's
                Kitchen. This way, the users are mimicking a possible scenario that occurs when using the app on a
                regular basis. When users first open the app, they will encounter the login screen. Once they login,
                they'll be led to the home screen where they can navigate to the Deddeh's Kitchen page. From here,
                they'll be able to order the chicken tacos and proceed to the checkout. The specific instructions used
                for user testing are in the following section.

                Imagine you're hungry and there are no restaurants around, so you decide to order delivery. You decide
                you want chicken tacos from your favorite restaurant Deddeh's Kitchen. Navigate through the app to
                Deddeh's Kitchen, and add the chicken tacos to your cart. Then, press the checkout button. Please think
                aloud when you navigate through the site as it helps us buils a better understanding of the user's
                thought process. Additionally, this is not a real app but instead an interactive mockup built using the
                prototyping software Figma.

            <h3>Analysis of User Testing</h3>
            <h4>Main Summary</h4>
            <p>
                Users were tasked with navigating through the application, finding a specific restaurant, adding food to
                the cart, and checking out. All users were successfully able to access Deddeh’s kitchen from the main
                screen, with relative ease and understanding. One user notes the logical layout of the application. It
                was surprising that some users found difficulty finding a way to checkout (need to open cart). Users
                otherwise had little to no issues completing the tasks.
            </p>

            <h4>Other Notes</h4>
            <p>
                On the main screen, users pressed the open indicator to access the next page. The initial purpose of the
                'open' box was to indicate whether the restaurant was currently open or closed. While the box is still
                functionally doing its job, this was not its intended purpose.
                One user struggled to find out what to do after the item was in the cart.
                Another user noted the confusion surrounding the navigation bar. They mentioned that putting the
                navigation bar at the top of the page rather than the bottom would be more intuitive and recommended
                that we use icons rather then the word for each navigation button.
                Another user noted the that having a few highlighted reviews on the details page rather than having to
                open another window to read all the reviews would be helpful.
            </p>

            <h4>Potential Interface Changes</h4>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Add a label to indicate that the open/close indicator is a status indicator, not a button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add an animation that shows that if the user wants to checkout, they press the cart button in the
                    bottom right.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Change the navigation bar to icons, and make it a fixed position over everything. It can remain at
                    the button, but keeping it fixed helps visibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We believe that moving it to the top could clutter content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add some “top” reviews to the restaurant details page, to help users decide on restaurants.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
