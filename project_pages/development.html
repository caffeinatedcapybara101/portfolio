                Development is a project creating an interactive interface, a Squishmallows site, that includes
                a sorting feature, filtering feautres, a reset feature, and a cart feature. The first part of
                the project,
                <a href="#goal-value">The Goal and Value</a>,
                involved identifying the overarching goal of the site and the different features necessary to
                achieve the goal. The second part of the project,
                <a href="usability">Usability Principles Considered</a>,
                involved identifying the important usability principles necessary to achieve the goal of the site,
                and how exactly to incorporate these principles. The final part of the project involved using React
                to create the site and providing and overarching view of how each feature was implemented.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The goal of this site is to aggreate a portion of all squishmallows so that people can view their
                different
                collectors details and the average prices of each of the different sizes. For anyone interested in
                purchasing a squishmallow or multiple from certain categories or of certain sizes, they can easily find
                those here.

                <li>
                    <span>Visibility of System Status</span>: Users can see which the exact properties they are
                    filtering/sorting by and how these selections affect the squishmallows displayed. The can clearly
                    see/select the price that corresponds to a particular side, the items in their cart, and the toal
                    price.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>User Control and Freedom</span>: Users have the ability to clearly remove items from their
                    cart if they accidentally add the wrong size or the wrong squishmallow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Recognition Rather than Recall</span>: The sorting and filter menu stays fixed in the page.
                    When the users are scrolling, they don't have to remember which filter or sort property they have
                    selected and they can easily change their selection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</span>: The page is not cluttered with text. The
                    squishmallow cards have only the essential information (name, category, sizes, ect.).
                    The sorting and filtering menu divides the different categories up based on their headers.

            <p>
                The link to the deployed site can be found

            <h3>The Item Cards</h3>
            <div class="component">
                <img style="width: 400px" src="../images/development/squishmallow-card.png">

                <p>
                    Each squishmallow card is a compnent. The component contains the information (name, category, year,
                    sizes, price) for the particular squishmallow and an cart button that allows you to add the
                    squishmallow (of the selected size and price) to the cart.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All squishmallows are stored in a list which is primarily responsible for maintaining
                    the current price for the squishmallow depending on which size is selected. The filtering and
                    sorting takes objects from this list to create the new filtered/sorted list. This list is then used
                    to display the Squishmallow component on the screen.
                </p>
            </div>


            <h3>Filtering and Sorting Categories</h3>
            <div class="component">
                <img style="width: 200px" src="../images/development/sort_filter.png">

                <p>
                    In terms of <span>filtering</span>, the user can filter based on category of squishmallow or based
                    on the available sizes. Each squishmallow on this page lies in one category only but can
                    come in a variety of sizes. When the user clicks on a filter button in the 'Category' section, the
                    categoryFilters state variable gets updated by adding the current filter parameter to the list. When
                    the user clicks on the filter buttons in the 'Size' section, the sizeFilters state variable gets
                    updated by adding the current filter parameter to the list.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In terms of <span>sorting</span>, the user can sort based on the name of the squishmallow
                    (this sorts in alphabetical order) or the year of the squishmallow (this sorts in
                    ascending order). When the user clicks on any of the sort buttons, the sortBy state variable gets
                    updated with the current sort parameter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When these state changes occur, the variable containing the selected squishmallows also changes
                    based on the filters/sorting parameters and the page gets updated to show the selected
                    squishmallows.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Aggregator</h3>
            <div class="component">
                <img style="width:400px" src="../images/development/aggregator.png">

                <p>
                    For the <span>aggregator</span> component of the site, I chose to implement a cart. The cart
                    keeps track of squishmallows, their size, the quantitiy, the price based on the item and quanitity,
                    and the total price of the cart.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When the user click the the cart button, the cartItems state variable gets updated with the current
                    squishmallow, the size, the price, and the quantity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When the user clicks on the '-', '+', and 'Trash' buttons within each item in the cart,
                    the cartItems state variable gets updated with the current quantity or current items
                    in the cart.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When these state changes occur, the page and the cart get updated to show the squishmallow added to
                    the cart.
