            <p>
                Personas and Storyboarding is a project designed to understand an interface, the Ten One
                Tea House Snackpass Kiosk, through the user's persepective by creating personas and
                a storyboard for one of the personas. This first part of this project,
                <a href="#preparation">Preparation</a>, included choosing an interface and understanding
                the process of using this interface. The second part of this project,
                <a href="#observations">Observations</a>, included observing user interaction with the interface and
                interviewing users. The third part of this project, <a href="#personas">Personas</a>, included
                creating personas based on the data collected in the observations section. The final part of this
                project, <a href="#storyboarding">Storyboarding</a> included choosing one of the personas and creating
                a story for the user's journey interacting with the interface.

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li> Why did you choose to place your order through the kiosk? </li>
                <li> What would keep you from using this kiosk? </li>
                <li> What was easy about placing your order using the kiosk? What was difficult? </li>
                <li> Is there anything you would add, remove, or change to improve your experience with using
                    the kios to order? </li>
                <li> Was there any particular feature that stood out to you? </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <!-- Key Observations -->
            <h3> Key Observations </h3>
            <p>
                The first person I actually observed was someone who did not end up using the kiosk - they walked over
                to the kiosk, but eventually left. This person ended up ordering at the counter and payed in cash.
                Since the kiosk only accepts card/Apple Pay, this person could not interact with the kiosk.
                The major difference between some of the users was the amount of time it took for them to order the
                drink itself. Certain users took the time to scroll through the menu and look the options whereas others
                immediately clicked on a category and a certain drink. Furthermore, the users that immediately selected
                a drink to order were also the users that did not take the time to review their purchase at the checkout
                screen and the users that opted in for the Snackpass rewards.
            </p>

            <!-- Interview Summary -->
            <h3> Interview Summary </h3>
            <p>
                Here are the main points and takeaways from the interviews:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    User 3 and the second friend for User 2 noted that were familiar with the interface and chose to
                    to use it to order rather than order at the counter because they wanted the Snackpass rewards. User
                    1, who wasn't familiar with the interface decided to try it out because it looked like an simple,
                    easy way to order a drink.
                </li>
                <li>
                    User 3 and the second friend for User 2 who were already familiar with the kiosk found the home
                    screen to be useless and thought that removing it would improve the speed of ordering and, thus,
                    their experience. However, user 1 who was not familiar with the interface actually
                    appreciated the home screen because they would not have known what the kiosk was for/whether
                    they should use it had the home screen not appeared.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A major component that user 3 wanted changed was the add-ons/options page. They noted that
                    the Snackpass app saves previous orders which typically saves them a lot of effort when ordering.
                    They wish that the kiosk would also save their information because they like ordering the same
                    drink with the same add-ons each time they are here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interestingly, all of the interviewed users the ordering process to be straightforward
                    and simple to understand. While User 1 did not find anything particularly difficult, they
                    did find the Snackpass reward feature confusing. They noted that they had not heard about
                    Snackpass which is why they opted out.
                </li>
            </ul>

                        already late to his section meeting. Unlike the Snackpass app, the kiosk has you input your
                        drink add-ons and preferences everytime you use it to order. While ordering his drink, Carson's
                        friend calls him telling him he'll be late if he doesn't leave Ten One now. Frustrated and
                        rushed,
                        he does not notice that he accidentally selected the wrong topping. Additionally, he scrolls
                        past a
                        required selection which slows him down even more since he has to go back and select an option

                        kiosk does not accept cash. When she first enters the shop, she decides to order at the kiosk
                        because she hates having to order in person. After she picks a drink to order, she
                        realizes that the machine does not accept cash and starts to get worried. She then realizes that
                        the machine might accept Apple Pay. Luckily, it does and she pays using her
                        phone. Since Carly is a freshman, she has never heard of Snackpass, but she decides to download
                        the app
                        and tell her friends about it.

                Overall, this project gave me a lot of insight into the different factors that designers have
                to account for when creating an interface. It also made me realize that different people have
                such different experiences with depending on the situation. For example, interacting with an interface
                when you are familiar with its components is extremely different than when you are new or
                interacting with an interface when you are rushing is extremely different than when you are
                taking your time.
