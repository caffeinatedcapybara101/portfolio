                I chose to examine the Snackpass order kiosk at Ten One Tea House in order to understand
                how and why users interact with this product.

                        The kiosk at Ten One allows for contactless ordering of drinks and helps with reducing the
                        wait time for ordering. It consists of a screen that allows customers to choose their drinks
                        and a stand with a card reader. When customers first arrive, the home screen contains a "Tap
                        to Continue" caption that informs users to tap anywhere on the screen to continue with the
                        ordering process.

                    <p>
                        Once customers tap the screen, they are met with a new interface that displays the menu.
                        The menu contains information about the different categories of drinks, the names of each
                        drink, the price of the drink, images of the drink, etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the customer taps on the drink they want to order, they are presented with options about
                        how they want their drink and other add-ons. The options are spilt into categories (size, milk,
                        milk foam, toppings, ice level, and sugar level). If the category is required, then it ensures
                        that users select an options. Additionally, if certain options within a category cost extra
                        money, the screen will disply exactly how much will be added to the total.

                    <p>
                        After users have selected all their add-ons, they can either add more drinks or check out. On
                        the checkout page, the users are able to see every item they have in their cart (along with
                        any choices/add-ons they selected) and the total price of their order.

                    <p>
                        Finally, when customers place the order, they are first presented with a screen that allows them
                        to select a tip. Once they have selected the tip and continued, they are presented with a screen
                        informing them how to make the payment. From here, they can use the card reader attached to the
                        kiok in order to pay. This card reader allows for cards (insert or tap to pay) as well as Apple
                        Pay. After the user pays, a screen appears that asks the user for a phone number and an option
                        to select whether they want to collect their Snackpass rewards. Once the user enters the phone
                        number and selects and option for rewards, another screen appears. The final screen displays the
                        user's order number. Then, when the user picks up their order, there is a recipt attached to the
                        drink, so they know exactly what they ordered and how much it cost.

            <h3> Key Observations </h3>
            <p>
                The first person I actually observed was someone who did not end up using the kiosk - they walked over
                to the kiosk, but eventually left. This person ended up ordering at the counter and payed in cash.
                Since the kiosk only accepts card/Apple Pay, this person could not interact with the kiosk.
                The major difference between some of the users was the amount of time it took for them to order the
                drink itself. Certain users took the time to scroll through the menu and look the options whereas others
                immediately clicked on a category and a certain drink. Furthermore, the users that immediately selected
                a drink to order were also the users that did not take the time to review their purchase at the checkout
                screen and the users that opted in for the Snackpass rewards.

            <h3> Interview Summary </h3>
            <p>
                Just as a reminder, here are the questions I asked when interviewing the users about their
                experience with the kiosk:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>
                    Why did you choose to place your order through the kiosk?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What would keep you from using this kiosk?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What was easy about placing your order using the kiosk? What was difficult?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is there anything you would add, remove, or change to improve your experience with using
                    the kios to order?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Was there any particular feature that stood out to you? Why?
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are the main points and takeaways from the interviews:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    User 3 and the second friend for User 2 noted that were familiar with the interface and chose to
                    to use it to order rather than order at the counter because they wanted the Snackpass rewards. User
                    1, who wasn't familiar with the interface decided to try it out because it looked like an simple,
                    easy way to order a drink.
                </li>
                <li>
                    User 3 and the second friend for User 2 who were already familiar with the kiosk found the home
                    screen to be useless and thought that removing it would improve the speed of ordering and, thus,
                    their experience. However, user 1 who was not familiar with the interface actually
                    appreciated the home screen because they would not have known what the kiosk was for/whether
                    they should use it had the home screen not appeared.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A major component that user 3 wanted changed was the add-ons/options page. They noted that
                    the Snackpass app saves previous orders which typically saves them a lot of effort when ordering.
                    They wish that the kiosk would also save their information because they like ordering the same
                    drink with the same add-ons each time they are here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interestingly, all of the interviewed users the ordering process to be straightforward
                    and simple to understand. While User 1 did not find anything particularly difficult, they
                    did find the Snackpass reward feature confusing. They noted that they had not heard about
                    Snackpass which is why they opted out.

                Crunched Carson is a student who is having a bad day and is in a time crunch because he is
                already late to his section meeting. Unlike the Snackpass app, the kiosk has you input your
                drink add-ons and preferences everytime you use it to order. While ordering his drink, Carson's
                friend calls him telling him he'll be late if he doesn't leave Ten One now. Frustrated and rushed,
                he does not notice that he accidentally selected the wrong topping. Additionally, he scrolls past a
                required selection which slows him down even more since he has to go back and select an option in this
                category.

                Confused Carly is a freshman who has never been to Ten One before and doesn't notice that the
                kiosk does not accept cash. When she first enters the shop, she notices the kiosk and decides to order
                from there because she hates having to order in person. After she spends some time scrolling through
                the menu, she decides on the drink she wants and order. At this point, Carly
                realizes that the machine does not accept cash and starts to get worried. However, she realizes that the
                machine might accept Apple Pay since most modern machines do. Luckily, it does and she pays using her
                phone. Since Carly is a freshman, she has never heard of Snackpass, but now that the knows Snackpass
                gives rewards, she decides to download the app and tell her friends about it.
